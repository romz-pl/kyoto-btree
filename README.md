* This is the refactored version of Kyoto Cabinet library.

* The original code was downloaded from [web page](http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/).

* _Kyoto Cabinet_ is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.

* For more information about B+ trees see:
   * [wiki pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B+_tree) in Wikipedia
   * wiki pages in my project [b-plus-tree](https://github.com/romz-pl/b-plus-tree/wiki)
